### **State** Matrix representing the grid with currently player and last piece placed. Each coordinate could be empty (E) have a red piece (R) or a yellow one (Y). Example:
    ([[E,E,E,E,E,E,E],
      [E,E,E,E,E,E,E],
      [E,E,E,E,E,E,E],
      [E,R,R,E,Y,E,E]],
      [E,R,Y,Y,R,E,E],
      [E,R,R,Y,Y,E,E]], yellow, (3, 1))

### **Initial State**
    ([[E,E,E,E,E,E,E],
      [E,E,E,E,E,E,E],
      [E,E,E,E,E,E,E],
      [E,E,E,E,E,E,E]],
      [E,E,E,E,E,E,E],
      [E,E,E,E,E,E,E]], red, (null, null))

### **Final States** Any state with four pieces of the same colour in a row. Example:
    ([[E,E,E,E,E,E,E],
      [E,E,E,E,E,E,E],
      [E,R,E,E,E,E,E],
      [E,R,R,Y,Y,E,E]],
      [E,R,Y,Y,R,E,E],
      [E,R,R,Y,Y,E,E]], yellow, (1, 2))

### **Operators**

**m**-> game matrix

Op | Pre-Condition | Effects | Description
---|---------------|---------|------------
Place yellow in i | i >= 0 and i < 7 and column i is not full | m[y][i] <- Y, y being the highest x = E  on column i
Place red in i | i >= 0 and i < 7 and column i is not full | m[y][i] <- R, y being the highest x = E  on column i
